
# Beyond Confidence: Adaptive and Coherent Decoding for Diffusion Language Models


This is a preliminary PyTorch implementation of our paper:

[Beyond Confidence: Adaptive and Coherent Decoding for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02044). 

If you have any problems, please email me (ck.ee@my.cityu.edu.hk).


# Usage

Run inference_optimization_release.py and choose different decoding types, i.e., "ours" (CCD) or "dream" （entropy）)
